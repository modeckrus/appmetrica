/// The class contains the starting configuration of the library.
/// Configuration parameters are applied from the moment the library is initialized. You can set:
/// * [apiKey] — application API key;
/// * [appVersion] — application version;
/// * [crashReporting] — flag for sending information about unhandled exceptions in the application. The default value is true;
/// * [firstActivationAsUpdate] — flag that determines if the first launch of the application is an update. The default value is false;
///   If the first launch of the application is defined as an update, the installation will not be displayed in reports as a new installation and will not be attributed to partners;
/// * [location] — device location information;
/// * [locationTracking] — indicates whether the device location information is being sent. The default value is true;
/// * [logs] — indicates that logging of the library is enabled. The default value is false;
/// * [sessionTimeout] — session timeout in seconds. The default value is 10 (the minimum allowed value);
/// * [statisticsSending] — indicates whether sending statistics is enabled. The default value is true;
/// * [preloadInfo] — a [PreloadInfo] object for tracking preinstalled applications;
/// * [maxReportsInDatabaseCount] — is the maximum number of events that can be stored in the database on the device before being sent to AppMetrica. The default value is 1000.
///   Values in the range [100; 10000] are allowed. Values that do not fall within this interval will be automatically replaced with the value of the nearest interval boundary;
/// * [nativeCrashReporting] — flag for sending information about unhandled exceptions in the application. Exceptions are caused by C++ code in Android;
/// * [sessionsAutoTracking] — indicates automatic collection and sending of information about the sessions of the application user. The default value is true;
/// * [errorEnvironment] — the environment of the application error in the form of a key-value pair. The environment is displayed in the crashes and errors report;
/// * [userProfileID] — user profile ID;
/// * [revenueAutoTracking] — indicates automatic collection and sending of information about In-App purchases. The default value is true.
